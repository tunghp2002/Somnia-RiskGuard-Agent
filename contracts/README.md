# Somnia RiskGuard Contracts

## Toolchain

- Solidity compiler: `0.8.35`
- Build/test runner: Foundry (`forge`)
- Libraries:
  - OpenZeppelin Contracts `@openzeppelin/contracts`

## Commands

```bash
pnpm --dir contracts build
pnpm --dir contracts test
pnpm --dir contracts format
```

`forge` must be installed locally for contract commands. The package scripts use a Node wrapper that works on Ubuntu, WSL, and Windows PowerShell by checking the normal Foundry install path and PATH.

## Smart-Account Inheritance Summary

`RiskGuardInheritanceRegistry` is the active inheritance contract path. It does not custody user funds. Instead, it stores one active inheritance plan per smart account:

- beneficiary addresses and basis-point shares
- heartbeat interval
- optional grace period
- optional beneficiary timelock
- last heartbeat/check-in time
- active/cancelled plan state

This keeps assets in the user's Somnia/Thirdweb smart account so the user can continue day-to-day native-token and ERC-20 usage. A separate smart-account executor/module must be granted bounded authority by that smart account before it can transfer assets after missed heartbeat conditions.

The previous standalone locked vault contract has been removed from the active code path because it required users to deposit funds they could no longer use normally.

## Somnia Testnet Deployment

Current Somnia Testnet deployment:

- `RiskGuardInheritanceRegistry`: `0xc0Fdb3c055F3B7C5fA93343349E0f713bC8e1D2c`
- deployer: `0x64769A00fB002b7ED192834443C9c819565Ab702`
- transaction: `0x2c92b3d3352f32f529b99c625bd8048cf20e1c9b306b9e493b0ad627071c335a`

Deploy the registry with Foundry:

```bash
forge create src/InheritanceRegistry.sol:RiskGuardInheritanceRegistry \
  --rpc-url $SOMNIA_RPC_URL \
  --private-key $AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY \
  --broadcast
```

After deployment, set the address in:

- `config/public-chains.json` under `chains.somnia-testnet.contracts.inheritanceRegistry`
- `.env` as `INHERITANCE_REGISTRY_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`

The registry itself does not move funds until each user's smart account has authorized the registry as an executor/module/session key. Users should keep day-to-day native tokens and ERC-20s in the smart account, not in this registry.

## Runtime Flow

1. A smart account calls `createPlan(...)` with beneficiaries, protected assets, heartbeat, grace, and timelock.
2. The registry rejects normal EOAs because they cannot execute `executeBatch(...)` later.
3. The smart account keeps holding and using native tokens/ERC-20s normally.
4. The user refreshes liveness through `checkIn()` or a successful agent heartbeat callback before grace ends.
5. After `lastHeartbeatAt + heartbeatInterval + gracePeriod + timelockPeriod`, Somnia Agents, Reactivity, a keeper, or any caller can trigger distribution.
6. The registry snapshots each protected asset balance once and asks the smart account to execute transfers by beneficiary share.
7. Failed transfers are skipped in agent/reactive mode, leaving that share in the smart account for retries. The manual `executeInheritance` path fails closed on transfer failure.

## Contract Tests

`contracts/test/InheritanceRegistry.t.sol` covers:

- creating one active plan per smart account
- rejecting a second active plan until cancellation
- updating beneficiaries and timing rules
- allowing `heartbeat = 1 day`, `grace = 0`, and `timelock = 0` for testnet
- cancelling plans and clearing beneficiaries
- rejecting bad shares, self-beneficiaries, and invalid duration bounds
- refreshing heartbeat deadlines with `checkIn()`
- Somnia agent heartbeat and distribution request tracking
- per-smart-account agent budgets
- native-token and ERC-20 distribution from an authorized smart account
- skip-on-fail distribution behavior
